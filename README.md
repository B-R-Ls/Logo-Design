Useing inquier and class / class inheritence, I've developed a program that take in user input to design a simple logo. This project helped me to further understand classes within node. During the process i ran into mutiple problems when calling upon the classes and useing the functions within them, but i perservered and was able to properly use them in the logo creation process.

## Installation

[Repository](https://github.com/B-R-Ls/Logo-Design)

## Usage

Upon start up, this program will ask the user for initials, text color, prefered shape, and shape color. With this information it will then take those values and insert them within set classes based on shape choice. Once within the class it will run the class functions inorder to produce the svg code with all preferences filled in. Finally the svg code will be written to a svg file to be viewed on a browser.
